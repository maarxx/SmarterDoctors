# Introduction

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod.

There is no GUI, and no options. It just works.

It helps many more Jobs are done in a smart priority sorted order, instead of just randomly.

# Explanation

As the inspiring primary feature, Doctors now treat patients in order of Fatal Disease Delta (Immunity - Severity), and then bleeding patients in order of time to bleed out.

Patients in bed are now fed in order of Malnutrition severity.

Animal Training is done in priority order of falling Tameness, so you don't lose any animals. Then, it is done in reverse order, where animals with more accumulated training already are trained more, and then animals with lesser training are done later. This means, if you specify too many Labradors to be trained in Hauling, instead of seeing all of them trained only halfway, you'll see some trained to full, and some not trained at all. Trainers won't waste time on more animals than they can handle.

For Sowing and Harvesting, higher fertility soil is done before lower priority soil. All things being equals, Haygrass is done last.

For Plant Cutting, all things being equal, Haygrass is done last.

For Construction, floors are a lower priority, and the spike trap is an even lower priority (it takes a disproportionate amount of work, especially if you have lots of them, and you don't want it to distract from building coolers/heaters/beds).

Pawns no longer try to cut trees (even blocking construction or roofs) unless they are assigned to Cut Plants too.

For Rescue to Bed, colonists are rescued before animals.
